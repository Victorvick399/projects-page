        <h1>PROJECTS</h1>
        <p>At Moringa school I have created projects which are mostly practice.THis is usually to sharpen my coding skills.Which is really happening.</p>
        <p>I haven't created the most projects but below is a list of the few that I have.I have also included a little description for them.</p>
          <ol>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/Victorvick399/Recipe">Recipe</a></li>
                    <p>I used this during the period I learning how to fork from Github.The language mostly used on this project is HTML but there is also a little bit of CSS.It mostly uses HTML and a bit of CI think it was basic 
                    and not really difficult.
                    </p>

              <li><a href="https://github.com/Victorvick399/First-website">First-website</a></li>
                   <p>This is the first webpage I have created in my life.For now it does not have a lot on design but I will work on it.
                    I used HTML to build it but later added some CSS.
                   </p>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/Victorvick399/Hello-world">Hello-world</a></li>
                   <p>This is a project that I did to help me practise.To practise for HTML and CSS.
                      It helped me so much improve on them both.Mostly because practise is essential when it comes to both.
