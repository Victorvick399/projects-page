            <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>I am an ambitious introvert.I am just from high school and I am praying that everything goes well for me.I decided to take programming because since I was young I have always loved tech.I have always been intrigued with websites and apps and very much more.As soon as I heard that I heard that I a chance to create or be atleast a part of this great world I couldn't refuse it.This is because in the near future everything will mostly go digital.Not only will this benefit me financially but also it will give me an opportunity to become a part of the new generation that will make almost evrything digital.I am also a huge <em>Manchester United</em> fanatic.I sadly don't have the best communication skills bit I make up for it with working extremely hard.I not only work hard but also work smart.This is not only to increase my output but also to increase the quality of my output.</p>
